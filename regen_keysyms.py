"""
The .XCompose file requires us to specify the names of the keys we want to
press. That's easy enough for letters and numbers, but some symbols need to be
specified by their name, such as `colon` or `overline` or whatever.

This script parses the linux keysymdef.h given to it, finds all possible keys
that could be pressed based on their XK_ definitions, gets the unicode
representation of them based on the U+nnnn representation in the comment,
and generates a list of symbolâ†’keyname mappins that can be used by the main
NXCompose script.
