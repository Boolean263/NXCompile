# This is an example XCompile source mapping file.

# Here I use Roman numerals (Unicode range U+2160 to U+217F) to demonstrate
# a 'gotcha' with XCompose files.
# Input sequences cannot have overlapping suffixes. That is, the following
# sequences are INVALID:

Ⅰ	I
Ⅱ	II
Ⅲ	III

# XCompose itself will silently ignore the II and III mappings.
# NXCompile will give a warning message about them.
# (And, if you use this file unaltered, for many of the mappings below.)

# To differentiate them, you need some sort of terminating keystroke at
# the end of the shorter ones. The following three sequences use a
# trailing space for this purpose:

Ⅰ	I 
Ⅱ	II 
Ⅲ	III 

# Note that some text editors and source-control software strip off
# trailing spaces in text files.

# My personal preference is to use a meaningful terminating keystroke
# where possible. In this case, I use a capital R for 'Roman' to indicate
# the end of the key sequence.
