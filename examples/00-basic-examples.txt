# This is an example XCompile source mapping file.

# Lines starting with a '#', and blank lines, are passed through to the
# output unaltered, because they have no effect on XCompose. You can use
# the `-s` option to NXCompile to have these lines ignored entirely.


# Syntax: The desired output is first, then a tab character,
# then the input sequence.

# Output can be multiple characters long in most recent versions of linux.
# (In practice, excessively long outputs can cause issues.)

# Unlike normal XCompose files, a '#' later in the line is NOT a
# partial-line comment marker. Otherewise you couldn't have a '#' in
# your input sequence.
❶	#1
❷	#2
# etc.

# Since a Tab character is used to separate the output text from the
# input sequence, the output text cannot itself contain a Tab character.
# Sorry.

# If you use vim as your editor, a modeline like the following may
# make it easier for you to see and edit your mappings.
# Other editors likely have similar settings.
